title: A named design-director role runs the ui design review in place of a general-purpose sonnet agent
variant: kc-dev-flow-2
profile: pilot
merge: pr
status: backlog
---

## Scope

- Source: the Captain 「我還是希望開設計總監，讓它來做目前指示的內容，等於派出的 general purpose sonnet 改成設計總監。此外，在可用前提，平行多派一個 gpt astra mid 來做設計輔助夥伴，合理嗎？」 (chat, 2026-10-22), then 「可以」 to FO's 「開一張「設計總監」任務，astra 輔助先用 POC 驗證，模型等量測結果再定，可以嗎？」 (chat, 2026-10-22).
- Shape asked for: `skills/ideation/design-review.md` dispatches a named `kc-dev-flow-2:design-director` agent, with an agent file that declares its model like chief-engineer and engineering-reviewer, carrying the existing brief unchanged; a parallel `gpt-6-astra` medium-effort design helper joins only if dev2-poc task design-helper-astra-poc shows it adds findings.
- Inputs before ideation: the read-only measurement of ui design reviews 2026-10-08 to 2026-10-22 (FO-dispatched, 2026-10-22) decides the declared model; dev2-poc task design-helper-astra-poc decides the helper.
- Upstream first: no design-director role in the installed plugins (searched 2026-10-22: `grep -rli 'design director'` over ~/.claude/plugins/cache and ~/.claude/skills found none); gstack `plan-design-review` is interactive, for a person, not a dispatched reviewer; the kc-dev-flow-2 chief-engineer and engineering-reviewer agent files are the pattern.
- Non-goals: changing the brief's eight dimensions or severities; a design review for tasks without `Surfaces: ui`.

## FO alignment

Alignment: needed at ideation; the declared model and whether the helper joins are his, after the measurement and the POC.
Surfaces: none
Visible change: none
Release review: not needed: workflow maintenance, on no journey map.

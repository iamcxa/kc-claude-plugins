# ideation-2

Dispatched: c27e76590c1d2dc910e7fa2d332242a7534df0b0 (workflow checkout, kc-dev-flow-2 0.27.0 README); batch 5, Captain revise
Model: sonnet

## Checklist

Redesign per the Captain's rulings in the ideation gate resolution reason (revise, 2026-10-21): no title hook (remove it from the design, criteria and word counts, and name the dev2-poc long-session POC as its reopen); keep the pointer and the named-path check; the pointer lives in a new AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md gains one  line; the pointer only says where ADRs live and when to look and restates no ADR text (kc-adr peer's boundary rule); qnow lands as its own task, not here; the path check runs as a path-filtered, non-required CI job; rewrite the criteria to match and recount the words FO reads
A `### Batch overlap` section naming each file the design would change and each other batch task (new-work-starts-from-a-story-map, codex-reader-reads-receipt-marker, merge-ask-holds-missing-clauses, fo-write-checks-parse-top-level, idle-names-failing-seeds, agent-reads-governing-adr) and live task of other sessions (kc-decision-log-p1, kc-decision-log-cli, kc-decision-log-handoff-trial, pr-review-lite-value-pilot, release-acceptance, journey-canvas-hosted-poc, journey-server-host-pilot (driven by other sessions; read only)) that changes the same file or check, so FO can order implementation
The words FO reads at each lifecycle moment, before and after, per root learning.md "Measure the words FO reads at each moment, not one file's size"
Acceptance criteria with reproducible evidence clauses and falsifiers, and unresolved decisions for the Captain, each with a recommendation and what gets worse under it

## Scope notes

Package root: /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.27.0

Profile: pilot. The Captain's words and the evidence are in the task file. This task is one of batch 5, Captain revise; read the other task files only as they stand, and do not edit them. Design against the current package source: kc-dev-flow-2/ in iamcxa/kc-claude-plugins at origin/main, released as 0.27.0 (read with `git -C /Users/kent/conductor/workspaces/kc-claude-plugins/colombo show origin/main:<path>` after `git fetch origin`). Check the chain first (Spacedock, then kc-dev-flow-2, then sibling adopters) and say what you found; for a third-party mechanism read its own docs or source, not an adopter's workaround.

Ideation writes no repository file, branch or commit; the design and criteria go in the task file. Do not comment on any PR or issue, and do not message any other session. Never run `git remote set-url` or any `git config` write in a worktree of this repository. Read adopter state (relay, web, qnow) only through read-only commands.

Send your completion message to `main` (the README's Dispatch facts: `team-lead` is not registered here).

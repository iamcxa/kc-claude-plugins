## Checklist

Independent verdict on PR #658 head 57673bfd against every acceptance criterion in the task file, re-running each evidence command and at least one falsifier per criterion yourself, and judging each limit the implementation report states
first validation; recount the words FO reads per moment with your own method, not the worker's recount.py; AC-9 is a post-release measurement and not a ship gate; the stale WORKFLOW_WORD_BUDGET mention in root learning.md is outside this PR's file list (FO's call), report it only
A minimal acceptance script the Captain can run (three to six steps, exact commands, expected output), run by you exactly as written in a fresh bash shell, with its observed output; /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.24.0/scripts/adr_lint.py docs/adr --since <base> with its exit code; your verdict naming the head, with findings classified by the workflow's Review-finding disposition

## Scope notes

Package root: /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.24.0

Profile: pilot. Candidate: iamcxa/kc-claude-plugins PR #658, head 57673bfd0a5154dfa072eff4fcb3a4ea6846801d, base origin/main. Batch-1 task; other batch-1 PRs are in flight and are not your candidate. Check out the head in a throwaway worktree (`git worktree add --detach /tmp/<name> 57673bfd0a5154dfa072eff4fcb3a4ea6846801d`) and remove it when done. Read and run only: do not push, comment on any PR, request reviews, or edit the candidate or its worktree. A repair goes back through FO. Read adopter state only through read-only commands.

Run kc-dev-flow-2/scripts/lint-skills.py and any package script under test from the candidate checkout, not from the package root. kc-dev-flow-2/scripts/test_sd_dispatch.py needs --sd-plugin-root; name the root and binary you use.

Never run `git remote set-url` or any `git config` write in a worktree of this repository. Run each suite and mutation with a time cap, and remove every throwaway worktree you add before reporting. The minimal acceptance script must run unchanged in a fresh shell, name any checkout or install it needs and write any package script as its full path; FO will run it exactly as written before the gate.

Send your completion message to `main` (the README's Dispatch facts: `team-lead` is not registered here).

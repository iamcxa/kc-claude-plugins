# ideation-1

Dispatched: 8bf4f3582411e8e4238f19fbadda8ddeca6767be (workflow checkout, kc-dev-flow-2 0.32.0 README); batch 8
Model: gpt-6-astra (Codex via Paseo, thinking high; the Captain's interim dispatch directive, chat 2026-10-26: 「接下來派工結束後新的派工盡量用 sol / astra，推理等級可以比 claude 高一級」)

## Checklist

A design for /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.32.0/scripts/delivery_gate.py to refuse a merge ask that lacks the second-reviewer line when the README's trigger holds, and a copilot not run line without the quote /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.32.0/extensions/copilot/copilot_review.py printed and a retry offer, replayed over the saved merge asks under merge/ in this workflow's tasks
A `### Batch overlap` section naming each file the design would change and each other batch task (archive-waits-for-observer-report, idle-hook-names-merged-tasks-without-learn, copilot-not-run-line-carries-quote, dispatch-carries-reserved-adr-number, seed-check-requires-schema-fields, journey-probe-finds-nested-maps, read-adr-honors-adr-folder) and live task of other sessions (adr-required-statement, journey-server-host-pilot, ops-inbox-r1-setup-and-isolation, pr-review-lite-value-pilot, adr-silent-undo-probe, comment-check-reaches-delivery-gate, journey-canvas-hosted-poc (driven by other sessions; read only)) that changes the same file or check, so FO can order implementation
The words FO reads at each lifecycle moment, before and after, per root learning.md "Measure the words FO reads at each moment, not one file's size"
Acceptance criteria with reproducible evidence clauses and falsifiers, and unresolved decisions for the Captain, each with a recommendation and what gets worse under it

## Scope notes

Package root: /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.32.0

Profile: pilot. The Captain's words and the evidence are in the task file. This task is one of batch 8; read the other task files only as they stand, and do not edit them. Design against the current package source: kc-dev-flow-2/ in iamcxa/kc-claude-plugins at origin/main (read the released version from kc-dev-flow-2/.claude-plugin/plugin.json there) (read with `git -C /Users/kent/conductor/workspaces/kc-claude-plugins/colombo show origin/main:<path>` after `git fetch origin`). Check the chain first (Spacedock, then kc-dev-flow-2, then sibling adopters) and say what you found; for a third-party mechanism read its own docs or source, not an adopter's workaround.

Ideation writes no repository file, branch or commit; the design and criteria go in the task file. Do not comment on any PR or issue, and do not message any other session. Never run `git remote set-url` or any `git config` write in a worktree of this repository. Read adopter state (relay, web, qnow) only through read-only commands.

Send your completion message to `main` (the README's Dispatch facts: `team-lead` is not registered here).

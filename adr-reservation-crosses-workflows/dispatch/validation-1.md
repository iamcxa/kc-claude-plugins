## Checklist

Independent verdict on PR #801 head 6a0a4aec against every acceptance criterion in the task file, re-running each evidence command and at least one falsifier per criterion yourself, and judging each limit the implementation report states
Judge the scope addition of one test-file assertion (implementation-1-message-1) and run the number guard check against the live spacedock-state branches read-only, stating which state checkouts it read
A minimal acceptance script the Captain can run (three to six steps, exact commands, expected output), run by you exactly as written in a fresh bash shell, with its observed output; /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.35.0/scripts/adr_lint.py docs/adr --since <base> with its exit code; your verdict naming the head, with findings classified by the workflow's Review-finding disposition

## Scope notes

Package root: /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.35.0

Profile: pilot. Start in the assigned worktree; verify pwd and git root before edits. Candidate: iamcxa/kc-claude-plugins PR #801, head 6a0a4aec60bb5900a0d363bae912acc5714f5974, base origin/main. This task; other PRs may be in flight and are not your candidate. Read and run the candidate from an export, not a git worktree: `git -C <repo> archive <head> | tar -x -C <new directory under /tmp>`, and diff with read-only `git -C <repo> diff <base> <head>`. Do not create or remove a git worktree; its metadata sits outside your sandbox and each one needs a Captain prompt. Commit your stage report with `spacedock state commit adr-reservation-crosses-workflows --workflow-dir /Users/kent/conductor/workspaces/kc-claude-plugins/colombo/.context/dev2-adoption/worktree/docs/dev2`. Never run `git remote set-url` or any `git config` write in a worktree of this repository. Do not push, comment on any PR, request reviews or mark ready.

Your final reply is your completion message: Paseo delivers it to FO when your turn ends. End your turn with the Done line below as that reply; do not send it with SendMessage or send_agent_prompt.

# implementation-1

Dispatched: 146727ded0d4ce8014ea0b41a45dc3409d6b269b (workflow checkout, kc-dev-flow-2 0.34.0 README); batch 13, first implementation dispatch
Model: gpt-6.1-sol (Codex via Paseo, thinking xhigh; the Captain, chat 2026-11-02, his model table: implementation Sol / xhigh)

## Checklist

One Draft PR (Conventional Commit title scoped to the plugin) from a branch off origin/main (713d4e6ed6381e65fa6d8305e08b282ceb56a8fb) implementing the approved design and acceptance criteria in the task file; the /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.34.0/scripts/delivery_gate.py steps check (package source kc-dev-flow-2/scripts/delivery_gate.py) and the question requirement, with D1 (chat asks held only when FO runs steps; observer reads the records), D2 (raise the workflow word budget by 55, 5781 to 5836) and D3 (reverse ADR 0024 D3 under its reopen clause) as recommended; only the files the design names
ADR 0054 records the ruling the design names, quoting the Captain's words from the task file and its gate records
Every acceptance criterion green with the evidence each names; each falsifier shown failing by a mutation you run (python3 -B, caches cleared)
kc-dev-flow-2/scripts/lint-skills.py (the repository copy CI runs), /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.34.0/scripts/adr_lint.py docs/adr --since <base> --require 0054 exit 0; /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.34.0/scripts/number_guards.py check exit 0; /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.34.0/scripts/comment_ratio.py within its maximum; roborev evidence= line; CI green on the PR head; CI cost measured or stated as not measured

## Scope notes

Package root: /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.34.0

Number guards: ADR: 0054

Profile: pilot. Approved design: ## Design and ## Acceptance criteria in the task file; ideation gate approved; the Captain's words are in the task's ideation gate record (read them there; this line does not restate them) and any ## Captain amendments. If a word-budget raise step is needed, quote the Captain's words from that gate record. If a change needs a file the design does not list, stop and return to FO.

Delivery: one pull request in iamcxa/kc-claude-plugins, in the worktree `dispatch build` made for you; `git fetch origin` first and base the branch on origin/main. Push and Draft PR under the Captain's standing grant in his global instructions (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, Autonomous action boundaries): "No ask on a repo Kent owns: push a branch and open a Draft PR once the work cleared its own bar". Open as Draft. Do not bump versions. Stage named files only, no empty commits. If a push or gh call is refused by the permission check, stop and report it; do not work around it.

Before reporting, commit and run `python3 /Users/kent/.claude/plugins/cache/kc-claude-plugins/kc-dev-flow-2/0.34.0/extensions/roborev/roborev_gate.py --repo <worktree> --base <base sha>`. On exit 1 fix the findings inside your scope, commit and run it again, at most twice, and report the rest as findings for FO. Put the printed `evidence=` line, or the `incomplete:` line on exit 3, in the stage report.

If you correct your stage report, append a complete new report under the exact heading `## Stage Report: implementation`, every item DONE or SKIPPED with its evidence, ending in a `### Summary` that says it supersedes the earlier one.

Never run `git remote set-url` or any `git config` write in a worktree of this repository. Do not request reviews, comment on any PR, mark ready or merge.

Your final reply is your completion message: Paseo delivers it to FO when your turn ends. End your turn with the Done line below as that reply; do not send it with SendMessage or send_agent_prompt.
Done line: Done: fo-tries-what-it-asks-the-captain completed implementation
